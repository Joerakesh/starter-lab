# ðŸš€ Starter Lab

A personal lab of mini-projects and experiments to understand the **basics of modern development workflows** â€” from integrating Python with HTML to configuring TailwindCSS and building dynamic pages with JSON.

This repository is meant for **learning**, **tinkering**, and building a strong foundation.

## ðŸ“¦ What's Inside

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `integrating-python-html/` | Learn how to connect Python (Flask) with HTML to create dynamic web pages. |
| `installing-tailwindcss/` | Step-by-step setup for TailwindCSS â€” from CDN to full CLI installation. |
| `dynamic-page-json/` | Create simple dynamic pages using data stored in JSON format. |

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To document and understand the **basics behind common development setups** and gradually build more advanced tools and workflows.

This is a living repo â€” more will be added as I explore topics like:

- JS frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- API creation & consumption
- Frontend tooling (Vite, Webpack, etc.)
- Deployment methods (GitHub Pages, Render, etc.)
